## Summary

Current OpenYurt provides 2 independent solutions in cloud edge comms domain, which are Raven and YurtTunnel.
Although they are implemented to meet different user requirements, they belong to the same domain for users.
They are located in different repos, so it's hard to maintain them from the project management perspective.
What's more important, although related docs are provided to users, it may lead to user confusion on how to
select them for their own usage scenarios.
This proposal aims to fix these issues by integrating YurtTunnel into Raven.

## Motivation

When Raven and YurtTunnel are combined together, the related implementation for cloud edge comms in dataplane
will be refined so that the related source codes organization will be optimized, so it will be much more easier
to maintain in future.
Besides, providing only one entry to users for their cloud edge comms usage scenarios will definitely improve
the user experience.

### Goals

To integrate YurtTunnel into Raven, we want to achieve the following goals:
- Move YurtTunnel implementation from openyurt repo to raven repo.
- Optimize YurtTunnel implementation which include ANP upgrade, iptables manager removement and etc.
- Fuse Raven and YurtTunnel into one unified cloud edge comms solution.

### Non-Goals/Future Work

At current stage, we mainly focus on fusing Raven and YurtTunnel into one solution, we will not try to
extend new features for them.

## Proposal

We know that YurtTunnel is a layer-7 DevOps traffic tunnel from cloud to edge, while Raven is a layer-3 data
traffic channel between cloud-edge or edge-edge. When we think to unify these 2 solutions, we prefer to
integrate YurtTunnel into Raven to extend Raven scope to cover YurtTunnel features.
About how to achieve the target in a graceful way, we thought about several solution alternatives.

- YurtTunnel Architecture:

- Raven Architecture:

### Raven & YurtTunnel fusion
 The related solution alternatives are described below in details:

1). Solution 1:	Integrate yurttunnel-server and yurttunnel-agent into raven-agent on cloud and edge node
- This solution aims to integrate YurtTunnel logic into raven-agent pod and hide its details to users completely,
    so when users deploy Raven into the cluster, YurtTunnel is enabled by default, we can call it "deep fusion".

					        -----------------------------------------
					        | Cloud Node                            |
					        |      ---------------------------      |
					        |      | raven-agent             |      |
						|      |  ---------------------  |      |
						|      |  | yurttunnel-server |  |      |
					        |      |  ---------------------  |      |
						|      ---------------------------      |
						--------------------|--------------------
					Cloud                       |
					----------------------------|---------------------------
					Edge                        |
					        --------------------|--------------------
					        | Edge Node                             |
						|      ---------------------------      |
					        |      | raven-agent             |      |
						|      |  ---------------------  |      |
						|      |  | yurttunnel-agent  |  |      |
					        |      |  ---------------------  |      |
						|      ---------------------------      |
					        -----------------------------------------

To achieve it, we mainly need to solve 2 problems:
- On Edge side, integrate yurttunnel-agent logic into raven-agent pod, no matter the edge node acts as
    gateway or ordinary role.
- On Cloud side, Integrate yurttunnel-server logic into raven-agent pod.

On Edge side, since both raven-agent and yurttunnel-agent are deployed by daemonset to edge nodes, it seems applicable to combine them together.
But on Cloud side we found several tricky issues:
- The raven-agent is deployed as daemonset on every cloud node, but yurttunnel-server is deployed as deployment with several replicas
  for HA scenario, how to judge which cloud nodes to host the yurttunnel-server?
- If we select the gateway cloud node to host the yurttunnel-server, there would be another issue:
  The gateway role will not be elected until user creates a "gateway" CR, so it will lead to yurttunnel-server function depends on gateway CR
  creation, which is obviously not reasonable.
- Even we have ways to find some cloud nodes to host yurttunnel-server, how to expose the yurttunnel-server service since the yurttunnel-server
  is integrated into some of the raven-agent pods?

By the analysis above, we can see that this "deep fusion" design is too ideal to be implemented, it doesn't make sense to
hide all the YurtTunnel details and integrate it deeply into raven-agent.

2). Solution 2: Integrate yurttunnel-agent into raven-agent while deploying yurttunnel-server independently on cloud side
- Since we met several tricky problems while integrating yurttunnel-server into raven-agent on cloud side, how about to
  deploy yurttunnel-server independently on cloud side? To reduce the confusions to users, we can rename yurttunnel-server
  to "raven-l7-server".

					        -------------------------------------------
					        | Cloud Node                              |
					        | ---------------     ------------------- |
					        | | raven-agent |     | raven-l7-server | |
						| ---------------     ------------------- |
						----------|-------------------|------------
					Cloud             |                   |
					------------------|-------------------|-----------------
					Edge              |                   |
					        ----------|-------------------|------------
					        | Edge Node                               |
						|       ---------------------------       |
					        |       | raven-agent             |       |
						|       |  ---------------------  |       |
						|       |  | yurttunnel-agent  |  |       |
					        |       |  ---------------------  |       |
						|      ----------------------------       |
					        -------------------------------------------

This solution is feasible theoreticallyï¼Œhowever we know that users don't have to enable Raven and YurtTunnel
features simultaneously, how to handle the condition that users only want to enable one of them?
Besides, this solution aims to fuse Raven and YurtTunnel on Edge side, but leave it alone on Cloud side, which seems not
a consistent design.

Any other solutions for it? Let's continue to go forward...

3). Solution 3: Implement a new CRD as a wrapper layer for users
- From the user experience point of view, how about to define a new CRD as the main entry for users to
  configure Cloud Edge communication? For example, we abstract 3 types of comms usage: nodeName, podIP and nodeIP.

						------------------------------------------------------
					        | Cloud Node 					     |
						|             ----------------------                 |
						|             | new CRD controller |                 |
						|             ----------------------                 |
						|   ----------------------------                     |
						|   | raven-controller-manager |                     |
						|   ----------------------------                     |
					        |   ---------------        -----------------------   |
					        |   | raven-agent |        |  yurttunnel-server  |   |
						|   ---------------        -----------------------   |
						-------------|--------------------------|-------------
					Cloud                |                          |
					---------------------|--------------------------|------------------
					Edge                 |                          |
					        -------------|--------------------------|-------------
					        | Edge Node                                          |
					        |   ---------------         ----------------------   |
					        |   | raven-agent |         |  yurttunnel-agent  |   |
						|   ---------------         ----------------------   |
						------------------------------------------------------

This solution aims to add an abstraction layer to hide the technical details of current Raven and YurtTunnel, the new
CRD operator is responsible for deploying the corresponding components to the cluster, but it may introduce new issues:
- It needs to implement a new operator, which improves the complexity.
- When users select podIP comms method, they need to create gateway CR as well for further configuration, while for
  the nodeName method, users don't need to create other CRs, so the user experience is not consistent.
- If we want to integrate gateway CRD into the new CRD, it also seems tricky because the new CRD is a cluster level
  singleton CRD, while users can create many gateway CRs for their usage scenarios.

It seems we need to think more about it...

4). Solution 4: Divide Raven into 2 subdomains: layer-7 traffic and layer-3 traffic
- When we thought why it's so hard to integrate YurtTunnel into Raven in a deep fusion way, we found the reason is
  they are totally 2 different solutions for different user requirements, they don't depend on each other and there
  are almost nothing in common from design to implementation between them. From the users perspective, they can select
  none/one/both of them according to their usage scenarios. Therefore, comparing to the "deep fusion", how about to implement
  it in a "shallow fusion" way?
- It means that we take YurtTunnel into Raven scope as well, but not merge YurtTunnel components logic into Raven
  components, as a result, the extended Raven includes 2 independent subdomains: Cloud to Edge layer-7 DevOps traffic and
  Cloud-Edge or Edge-Edge layer-3 traffic, they are not coupled to each other, users can select them conveniently by
  deploying the related components into their cluster.

Of course, to make alignment for the whole design, current Raven and YurtTunnel components need to be renamed to
keep a common style. For example:
- `yurttunnel-agent`  -->  `raven-l7-agent`
- `yurttunnel-server` -->  `raven-l7-server`
- `raven-agent`       -->  `raven-l3-agent`
- `raven-controller-manager`  -->  `raven-l3-controller`

					        ------------------------------------------------------
					        | Cloud Node 					     |
						|    -----------------------                         |
						|    | raven-l3-controller |                         |
						|    -----------------------                         |
					        |    ------------------       -------------------    |
					        |    | raven-l3-agent |       | raven-l7-server |    |
						|    ------------------       -------------------    |
						-------------|--------------------------|-------------
					Cloud                |                          |
					---------------------|--------------------------|------------------
					Edge                 |                          |
					        -------------|--------------------------|-------------
					        | Edge Node                                          |
					        |    ------------------       --------------------   |
					        |    | raven-l3-agent |       |  raven-l7-agent  |   |
						|    ------------------       --------------------   |
						------------------------------------------------------

This "shallow fusion" solution has several advantages:
- The layer-7 traffic is separated from the layer-3 traffic, so they will not affect each other.
- The architecture is clear and it's convenient for users to select for their usage scenarios.
- It keeps the core logic of current Raven and YurtTunnel unchanged, so it can be implemented without much effort.

This solution aims to integrate YurtTunnel into Raven in a "shallow fusion" way, which is actually a tradeoff solution
under the limitation of current Raven and YurtTunnel design, but if we assume YurtTunnel doesn't exist, how will we extend
the layer-7 DevOps feature basing on Raven architecture? Let's start the brain storming...

5). Solution 5: Break the shackle and redesign & reimplement the layer-7 tunnel solution basing on Raven architecture
- Since it's hard to integrate YurtTunnel into Raven in a "deep fusion" way for the shackle that we want to keep most of the
  core logic unchanged for current Raven and YurtTunnel, we can break it to open up a new idea: redesign & reimplement layer-7
  tunnel solution basing on Raven architecture.

						|       ---------------------------       |
						-------------------------------------------

This solution is the best solution till now from the design perspective, it provides a more consistent and unified solution to users gracefully.
But it almost means to re-implement YurtTunnel into Raven, which needs much more effort than other solutions.

Conclusion:
- By evaluating all the alternatives above, and after disscussing with the community members, we achieved an initial agreement:
	- In the long run, Solution 5 is the best solution to provide a deeply unified solution to users. Although it needs much more effort.
	- In the short run, Solution 4 is a tradeoff shallow fusion solution which is acceptable as well at current stage.

We will evaluate the design and effort of solution 5 in the next few weeks, and nail down which one to select afterwards.
